# What are these?

A couple of sh*t scripts to start working on a new linux environment. 
Tested in Ubuntu 20.04 and Fedora 35

The Fedora 35 is more up to date. and will start a new system with everything you need to start working and install a more sensible window manager (dwm) for systens that have the computational power similar to a potato.
